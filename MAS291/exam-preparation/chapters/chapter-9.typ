+ A manufacturer makes ball bearings that are supposed to have a mean weight of 30g. A retailer suspects that the mean weight is actually less than 30g. The mean weight for a random sample of 16 ball bearings is 28.8g with a standard deviation of 3.8g. At the 0.05 significance level, test the claim that the mean is less than 30g. Assume that the sample has been randomly selected from a population with a normal distribution. \
    Let $t_(0.05, 15) = 1.75$, $t_(0.025, 15) = 2.13$
    + Test statistic $t=−1.463$. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean is less than 30g.
    + Test statistic $t=−1.263$. There is not sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean is less than 30g.
    + Test statistic $t=−1.463$. There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean is less than 30g.
    + Test statistic $t=−1.263$. There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean is less than 30g.
    + None of the other choices is correct.

    Given:
    - $n = 16$
    - $overline(x) = 16$
    - $sigma = 3.8$
    - $alpha = 0.05$
    $sigma$ known $=>$ Case 1

            H_0": " mu = 30,
            H_1": " mu < 30,
        ) \
    $
    $
        omega_alpha = (-infinity, -t_(alpha, n - 1)) approx (-infinity, -1.75) \
        t_0 = (overline(x) - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n)) = (28.8 - 30) / (3.8 / sqrt(16)) approx -1.263 in.not omega_alpha
    $
    $=>$ Reject $H_0$ \
    $=>$ The mean is less than 30g \

+ Medicare would like to test the hypothesis that the average monthly rate for one-bedroom assisted-living facility is equal to \$3,300. A random sample of 12 assisted-living facilities had an average rate of \$3,690 per month and a standard of \$530. It is believed that the monthly rate for one-bedroom assisted-living facility is normally distributed. Use the significance level of 0.05 for this hypothesis test, what is the critical value? \

+ The Department of Mathematics would like to test the hypothesis that the average debt load of graduating students with a Bachelor's degree is equal to \$17,000. A random sample of 34 students had an average debt load of \$18,200. It is believed that the debt load follows a normal distribution with the standard deviation of \$4,200. At the significance level of 0.05, the critical value(s) for this hypothesis test would be \_\_\_\_\_. \
